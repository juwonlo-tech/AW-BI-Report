# Adventure Works PowerBI Report
 
This repository contains the BI solution developed for a manufacturing company - Adventure Works. 
Given the data files containing sales for 3 years, returns, products, customers and territories, the organization would like to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers.

## The Model:

The first part of developing a BI report/ dashboard is data modelling. The relationship between data files has to be established.
The model created for this project is seen below:

## The Report

After the structure of the model has been established, the report is then developed. To gain some insight into the data, data analytics expressions commonly referred to as DAX were used for some computations. The comprehensive report produced shows the company's total sales, total profit, the quantity of products sold in 3 years, the quantity of products sold by category, and a lot of other useful information. 
Managers and C-suite personnels can drill down on this report to view information based on year and month, continent and country, and category and subcategory of products.

Screenshots of the report is seen below:
